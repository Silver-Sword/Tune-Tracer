## Composition Tool

This composition tool allows you to create your own composition, as well as collaborate in real time. It uses Vexflow to render music notation, D3.JS for interactivity features, Tone.JS for playback, and Firebase for networked updates, backend logic, and collision resolution. It features music playback, note placement with your mouse, dynamic music notation adjustments, and much more.
